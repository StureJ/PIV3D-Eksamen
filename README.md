The Game:
The idea of the game came from mix of classic FPS (First-person shooter) like Doom (1993) & Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and round-based survival games like the zombie-mode in Call of Duty. The player controls a nameless character that must survive and kill as many enemies as possible (slimes) with a limited number of bullets. The player has a maximum of ten shots before they must reload the gun. The goal of the game is to get the highest score (kills) without dying.

The main part of the game consists of:
•	Player – The character that the user plays as. Moved with WASD keys.

•	Camera – Locked in a first-person perspective. Moved with the mouse.

•	Shooting – Limited range with a limited ammunition count and fixed damage. Fired by clicking the mouse1 button.

•	Enemies – Rapidly spawning enemies that runs towards the player. Has a set amount of health (20) and awards 1 point per kill.

•	Health & Shield – Health is a fixed amount that cannot be regain once lost, some Shield is regained upon killing an enemy. If the health and shield drop below or equals zero, the game resets.

•	Ammunition – A fixed amount that the player needs to be able to fire the gun. Cannot be regained, so the player must use it sparingly.
